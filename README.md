## [Bi-Directional Cascade Network for Perceptual Edge Detection(BDCN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10903.pdf)


This repo is an implementation of BCDN  in Python3 that's actually runnable out of the box on your own images. If you want to train your own model or go deeper in the code, consider looking into the original repo for more information. For this implementation an Nvidia GPU is needed.

### Installing:
If you don't have Pytorch installed: first go to the Pytorch site and install it. If you have an Nvidia GPU be sure to get the exact version of CUDA which matches the Pytorch version (At the moment of writing CUDA is on 10.2 but Pytorch on CUDA10.1)
Follow the getting started here https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

<b>With Pytorch installed:</b>
Clone this repo with git or just download the zip and unzip it. Go to its folder location in command line or your virtual environment and run 

<b>pip install requirements.txt</b>

This should install all prerequisites except Pytorch and Torchvision because somehow the super intelligent guys over at Facebook can't figure out how Pip works

With the repo ready download the original pretrained models from here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CmDMypSlLM6EAvOt5yjwUQ7O5w-xCm1n/view
Unzip them and drag the 4 models into the 'models' folder

### Running (evaluation)
Put your images in the '\images' folder and run main.py.
A few parameters for settings such as which of the 4 models to use can be found at the bottom of main.py in the parse_args() method.
If you get an error about memory usage consider downsizing the resolution of the images in your folder, or putting less of them in at the same time. 4K images will almost definitely get you a memory crash.
